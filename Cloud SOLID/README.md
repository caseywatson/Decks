## Cloud SOLID: Building Highly-Maintainable Applications in a Cloud-Enabled World
### Abstract
First proposed in the early 2000s, SOLID principles are widely-adopted guidelines for building highly cohesive, loosely coupled applications. This session paints a picture of SOLID principles within the frame of modern cloud architecture. In this session, we will walk through each of the five SOLID principles, from Single Responsibility to Dependency Inversion, as we follow a fictional retailer, Contoso Outdoor Living, on their journey from on-premises to the cloud. Join us as we dive deeper, discussing how advances like Microservices, PaaS and Serverless architecture are fueling a revolution in the way architects think about SOLID design. We'll show you not only how to design "for the cloud", but how to treat cloud as a pattern that can be applied to a heterogeneous cloud environment across Azure, AWS and other platforms. By the end of this session, you will not only have a firm grasp on SOLID principles, but also understand how to fully leverage the cloud to apply these guidelines to build robust, highly maintainable applications.
